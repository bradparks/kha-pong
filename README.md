# kha-pong

Sources for a "Pong" arcade video game clone, written in Haxe using the Kha framework.

This is a "learning repository", in a sense. Commit messages are descriptive and concern both the Kha framework and the "Pong" cloning process.

The code wasn't written in an optimal way, but it will likely be revisited in the future.
